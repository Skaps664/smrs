# .github Directory

This directory contains GitHub-specific configuration and instructions.

## Contents

### `copilot-instructions.md`
**Purpose:** Instructions for GitHub Copilot (and developers) on maintaining project documentation.

**Key Rule:** Whenever ANY change is made to the project, the `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` file MUST be updated accordingly.

This ensures that the comprehensive project documentation stays current and accurate for:
- Potential investors
- Project buyers
- New developers joining the team
- Stakeholders reviewing the system

**Always read and follow these instructions before making project changes.**

## Future Files (Planned)

- `workflows/` - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - PR template for code reviews
- `CODEOWNERS` - Code ownership for auto-assignment
- `dependabot.yml` - Automated dependency updates

---

**Note:** This directory is part of the project's commitment to maintaining high-quality, up-to-date documentation.
